    - paragraph: "Bento is an open source framework developed by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research to support data sharing. It provides a structure to enable groups to quickly stand up and then configure a data sharing environment for life science data - groups can use Bento to share data amongst themselves or with a larger community. Bento's reference implementation contains a data model that is compatible with the Cancer Research Data Commons' Harmonized model (CRDC-H) such that Bento instances can be connected into and inter-operate with the CRDC. Users can customize the data model for their own needs. Bento also contains a User Interface and an API for programmatic access."

    - paragraph: "The General Commons (GC), formerly Cancer Data Service (CDS) is one of the Data Commons under the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) data ecosystem. GC continues to evolve as a data-type agnostic data commons, to meet the data needs of various NCI-funded programs."
    - paragraph: "The GC provides secure storage and data sharing capabilities, on the cloud, for studies that fall under the following categories:"
    - listWithBullets: 
      - "Studies with data that do not match the requirements of the existing CRDC Data Commons (Genomic Data Commons, Proteomic Data Commons, Imaging Data Commons etc.)"
      - "Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria and/or the required metadata for any CRDC data commons"
    - paragraph: "The GC is home to a combination of open and controlled access (sensitive) data. The GC portal is accessible to all users for searching data across all studies which have submitted data to GC.  This requires no login and so allows any users to check if the GC has the data of their interest before going through the process of requesting access. To access sensitive data (controlled access data) in the GC, users must obtain authorization through the NCBI’s $$[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/ title: 'Visit the NCBI website')$$ system. Open access data is publicly accessible; it does not require any authorization."
    - paragraph: "General Commons is a cloud repository and makes data available on the NCI’s Cloud resource, the Cancer Genomics Cloud by Velsera. The GC portal does not facilitate direct downloads of data from the cloud. However, programs/initiatives willing to fund the download costs for their users with approved dbGaP access to the data can reach out to the $$[CRDC helpdesk](NCICRDC@mail.nih.gov title: 'Email the CRDC helpdesk')$$ for further information."

Researchers can explore the data hosted in GC using the following different methods: Search by participant IDs: upload a list of known IDs to get the metadata associated with those participants"
      - "Search using filters such as Study, Experimental Strategy, Tumor, Sex, and File Type etc."
      - "Search using a programmatic approach by querying the entire GC schema using the GraphQL endpoint"
    - paragraph: "Once a researcher has filtered down to a cohort of interest (files, samples, Participants etc.), that set can be added to the \"shopping cart,\" from which a manifest can be exported/downloaded.

    - paragraph: "The NCI Cloud Resources are cloud platforms for analyzing data hosted in CRDC. Data hosted in GC is made accessible on the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) by Velsera. This cloud-based platform eliminates the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them work in a secure cloud environment that provides on-demand computational capacity.  The NCI Cloud Resources, including CGC, make it possible to use publicly available analytical tools applied to the selected data, or to bring custom analytical tools to their secure environments. The NCI Cloud Resources also make it` possible to upload private data for secure comparative analysis."
    - paragraph: "Manifests generated on the GC portal can be exported and uploaded on to the CGC and the files accessed in CGC’s private workspaces. The Data can then be analyzed using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit."
